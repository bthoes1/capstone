        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p class="problem-description">
            Designers and urban planners have been arguing for decades about what constitutes the ideal transit map. In the age of navigation apps and step-by-step wayfinding, such debates may seem less relevant than ever. The static transit map has become a relic of sorts, acting as a perfunctory reference point and neglecting its potential usefulness to certain users. Through the lens of the downtown Minneapolis bus transit map, this project embraces a user experience focus and research-driven design process to expand and improve on the classic bus map.

            Attempting to decipher the downtown bus map in Minneapolis can be frustrating enough to send a user straight to their smartphone for simple, step-by-step navigation; however, an improved map that prioritizes clarity, consistency, and ease of interpretation can lead to greater awareness of a geographic landscape and increased confidence for users, opening new doors for exploration in oneâ€™s own city.
